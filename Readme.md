# super-shitty-simple-static-site-generator

## What the fuck is this?

This is a super shitty simple static site generator.

To use it, you write one Markdown file. Just one.
And keep it simple, none of that hipster CSS bullshit.

There is a Python script that is simple as all fuck.
It just turns your Markdown into HTML. Now do you see
why you have to keep it simple?

Deploy your one single HTML file with GitHub Pages.
Now put your feet up, turn off the computer, and pat
yourself on the back, champ. You just launched an app.

## How the fuck do I build it?

You wanna build the project? Okay skipper, strap in.
Copy and paste this into your terminal:

    ./Taskfile build

Don't fucking ask where to run that command, numnuts,
you already know you should be running all these
commands from the repository directory.

## How the fuck do I look at it?

Fire up your dial up connection - don't worry, you won't
need a fast connection because you're downloading _one
single fucking page of plain HTML_.

Now copy and paste this into your terminal:

    ./Taskfile serve

Now open your web browser and go to <http://localhost:8000>
and feast your eyes on that delicious HTML.

## How the fuck do I deploy it?

Okay Einstein, hold on tight, you're gonna need to copy and paste
one more command:

    ./Taskfile deploy

That's fucking it.

## Where the fuck did it go?

Assuming you didn't completely fuck this up, if your super shitty simple
static site repository is at `foobar/my-shitty-site` then it's gonna be
public on the web at  

    https://foobar.github.io/my-shitty-site

Congratulations genius, you're on the Internet.
